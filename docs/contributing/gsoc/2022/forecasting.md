# Time-Series Forecasting and Anomaly Detection

Time-Series Forecasting & Anomaly detection has paramount importance in many
real-world problems like infrastructure monitoring, stock exchange, etc.
Currently, DFFML has limited integration with time-series data formats and
implementation of relevant models. This project aims to add basic support for
commonly used datasets, models, and data pre-processing/cleaning methods for
time-series data.

This project consists of four phases (Documentation & Testing is required in every phase):

1. Implementation of Common Datasets:
    - Related Issue: #1319
    - Add at least 2 datasets.
2. Implementation/Updating of Operations:
    - Related Issue: #1321
    - Add at least 2 operations.
3. Implementation of  Relevant Models:
    - Related Issue: #1320
    - Add at least 3 models.
4. Add documentation and examples showing all the three previous phases in
   action together. You can use Jupyter notebooks, or rST with python scripts
   and CLI examples, for the same.

## Skills

- Python

- Experience with various machine learning frameworks (Pytorch & TensorFlow
  would be a plus)

## Difficulty
